The following represents a set of tests that might be considered. The
list is not required, nor is it complete, but may be used as a goal
for semantic analysis.

** PARTIALLY COMPLETE 
   recognizes returning numbers
   - need to work on returning variables and expressions
functions declared int or float  must have a return value of the
   correct type.

* void functions may or may not have a return, but must not return a
   value.
parameters and arguments agree in number
parameters and arguments agree in type
operand agreement
operand/operator agreement
array index agreement
* variable declaration (all variables must be declared ... scope)
* variable declaration (all variables declared once ... scope)
* void functions cannot have a return value
* each program must have one main function
return only simple structures
* variables should not be type void
each function should be defined (actually a linker error)
================================================================================  

DataItem item = new DataItem(token, currentScope);
table.insert(item);

program -> type-spec ID VF declaration-list'
declaration-list' -> type-spec ID VF declaration-list' | empty 

////variable or function
VF -> A | AX    
    
var-declaration -> type-spec ID A  

////variable, regular or array 
A -> ; | [ NUM ] ;  

////function
AX -> ( params ) compound-stmt
