The following represents a set of tests that might be considered. The
list is not required, nor is it complete, but may be used as a goal
for semantic analysis.

* functions declared int or float  must have a return value of the
   correct type.

* void functions may or may not have a return, but must not return a
   value.
parameters and arguments agree in number
parameters and arguments agree in type
* operand agreement
* operand/operator agreement
array index agreement
* variable declaration (all variables must be declared ... scope)
* variable declaration (all variables declared once ... scope)
* void functions cannot have a return value
* each program must have one main function
? return only simple structures
* variables should not be type void
* each function should be defined (actually a linker error)
* main is declared last
